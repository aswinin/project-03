# Project Thoth
In most manufacturing sites, machines tools that have some level of automation capabilities, such as Computer Number Control or CNC for short, are operated at an individual level without the ability to optimize their performance in real-time through feedback loops or by looking at the overall production line.
Use Case: Consider a CNC machine which breaks down if the temperature increases over 300F. Current CNC machines do have temperature sensors, but they cannot perform analytics on the historical data which results in unscheduled outages. Each outage takes 1-4 hours to restart production and may cost up to $100k.
We want to build a technology solution which can leverage the sensor data from machine and provide useful information for predictive maintenance or performance optimization.
