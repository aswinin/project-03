This project is a picture taking / emotional analysis hardware/software package. Relevant libraries are included in the source/support files. We utilized the Tessel 2, Node/ NPM and standard Creative webcam. We also used the Microsoft Cognitive Emotion API, which requires signing up for a free account to generate an application key. We are assuming familiarity with Node and NPM. If not, please go to this link to learn more: https://nodejs.org/en/
